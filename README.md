# Feature Gate Multisig Tool

CLI tool for creating and managing Solana feature gate multisigs using the Squads protocol. Enables collective governance over Solana feature activations and revocations.

## Installation

The tool is distributed as source: you build the exact code you reviewed, and
`--locked` builds use the committed lockfile, which pins every dependency by
version and checksum.

Requires a Rust toolchain ([rustup](https://rustup.rs)), and `libudev-dev` +
`pkg-config` on Linux (for hardware-wallet support).

Install a released version:

```bash
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/nbelenkov/feature-gate-multisig --tag <version>
```

Or clone and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nbelenkov/feature-gate-multisig.git
cd feature-gate-multisig
git checkout <version>   # pick a release tag; omit for the development branch
cargo build --release --locked
```

Binary: `./target/release/feature-gate-multisig-tool`

Releases are announced as git tags; see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what
each version contains.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive mode (recommended)
feature-gate-multisig-tool

# Direct commands
feature-gate-multisig-tool create --keypair ~/.config/solana/id.json
feature-gate-multisig-tool show <MULTISIG_ADDRESS>
feature-gate-multisig-tool config
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `create` | Create a new feature gate multisig with an activation proposal |
| `show <address>` | Display multisig details, members, and proposal status |
| `verify <address>` | Check program authenticity, feature state and owners on every configured network |
| `propose` / `approve` / `reject` / `execute` | Act on a proposal non-interactively |
| `config` | Show saved configuration |
| `interactive` | Launch interactive menu (default) |

### Scripting

`verify` exits non-zero when a check fails **or** cannot be completed, so it can
gate a runbook:

```bash
feature-gate-multisig-tool verify "$MULTISIG" && \
  feature-gate-multisig-tool approve --multisig "$MULTISIG" --kind activate --index 1 --yes
```

It still reports every problem in one run rather than stopping at the first.
A non-zero exit means the multisig has not been shown to be correct — not
necessarily that it is malicious; an unreachable network fails the same way.

`--yes` resolves each confirmation to its default answer. It does not force an
action through: a proposal this tool cannot classify, and any config change
(membership or threshold), abort under `--yes` and need an interactive decision.

## Interactive Mode

> **See [docs/WORKFLOWS.md](docs/WORKFLOWS.md) for detailed step-by-step examples.**

The interactive menu provides:
- **Create new feature gate multisig** - guided setup with member collection
- **Show / Verify feature gate multisig** - inspect any address
- **Proposal Actions (Approve/Reject/Execute/Rekey/Revoke)** - act on proposals
- **Show configuration** - view saved settings

### Proposal Actions

Choosing **Create (Activate / Revoke / Rekey)** asks which transaction type:

| Type | Effect |
|---|---|
| Activate Feature Gate | queue a feature for activation at the next epoch boundary |
| Revoke Feature Gate | close a **pending** activation and burn its lamports to the incinerator |
| Rekey Multisig | **irreversible**: replaces every member with an unsignable dummy and sets threshold 1, so no proposal can ever pass again |

Approve, Reject and Execute act on proposals that already exist, and take the
kind from the on-chain transaction rather than from `--kind`, so an existing
proposal cannot be mislabelled.

## Proposal Structure

When a multisig is created, one proposal is automatically generated:

| Index | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| 1 | Vault Transaction | Feature Activation |

**Note**: Activating or revoking a feature gate does not change the multisig threshold.

`create` also adds a throwaway contributor member with Initiate-only permission,
generated on the fly and never saved. Its key is discarded, so that member can
never act again and a "2 member" multisig reports 3 members.

Revocation only works while the feature is **Pending**. Once the runtime stamps
`activated_at` at an epoch boundary it is permanent, and the program rejects the
instruction with `InvalidAccountOwner`.

Revocation proposals are **not** pre-created. If you need to revoke a feature, create a new revocation proposal using "Proposal Actions" → "Revoke Feature Gate" → "Create". See [Emergency Revocation workflow](docs/WORKFLOWS.md#4-emergency-revocation) for details.

## Parent → Child Multisig Voting

For programmatic voting from a parent multisig:

> **Important**: Add the parent's **vault PDA** (not multisig address) as a member of the child multisig with Vote/Execute permissions.

The **fee payer keypair** must be a member of the parent multisig with Initiate.
Here `voting_key` and the fee payer are deliberately *different*: pass the parent
multisig as `--voting-key` and sign with your own key.

The parent multisig address cannot sign during CPI - only the vault PDA can be
signed for using PDA seeds. That PDA is off-curve, so no private key exists for
it; the Squads program signs as it once a parent proposal passes.

```
Parent vault PDA = get_vault_pda(parent_multisig, 0)
```

The tool detects the mode automatically: if `--voting-key` resolves to a Squads
multisig account, it takes the parent path.

**Each child action costs three parent transactions** - create the parent
proposal, approve it, execute it - and only the execute reaches the child. So one
activation is six, and a revoke drill is fifteen. The CLI prompts for all three
in sequence; interrupting between them leaves a half-finished parent proposal
and the child untouched.

The CLI will display the required PDA if misconfigured. See [Parent Multisig Voting workflow](docs/WORKFLOWS.md#3-activating-a-feature-parent-multisig-voting) for detailed steps.

## Configuration

Stored in your OS config directory (for example `~/.config/feature-gate-multisig-tool/config.json` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/feature-gate-multisig-tool/config.json` on macOS). Run `feature-gate-multisig-tool config` to print the exact path:

```json
{
  "threshold": 2,
  "members": ["<pubkey1>", "<pubkey2>"],
  "networks": ["https://api.devnet.solana.com"],
  "fee_payer_path": "usb://ledger",
  "voting_key": "<pubkey1>"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `threshold` | Required signatures |
| `members` | Saved member public keys |
| `networks` | RPC endpoints for deployment |
| `fee_payer_path` | Keypair path (file or `usb://ledger`) |
| `voting_key` | Default voting identity: your own key, or a parent multisig |

**Voting as yourself: `voting_key` and `fee_payer_path` must be the same key.**
Only the fee-payer keypair is loaded, and the voting key has to sign, so a
mismatch fails fast rather than producing an unsignable transaction:

```
Error: In EOA mode, voting_key must match fee_payer.
```

That rule inverts when voting through a parent multisig; see below.

## Network Support

- Mainnet: `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`
- Devnet: `https://api.devnet.solana.com`
- Testnet: `https://api.testnet.solana.com`
- Custom RPC endpoints supported

The cluster is identified by its **genesis hash**, and mainnet gets the strict
checks. A forked-mainnet staging cluster reports mainnet's genesis hash by
design, so neither this tool nor a hardware-wallet screen can tell the two
apart. When rehearsing against a fork, put **only** the staging RPC in
`networks`: a member with mainnet still in the list who picks the wrong entry
signs a real mainnet transaction with real keys.
